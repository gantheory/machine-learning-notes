notes related to machine learning techniques

# Basic

## Approximate Nearest Neighbors

given feature vectors, find its top k neighbors approximately

## Cosine Similarity

(maybe) the fastest way to calculate cosine similarity in python

Note: implementation in pure Python can be very slow

## Norm

the fastest way to calculate norm of vectors, e.g. 2-norm

# Natural Language Processing

## Word Embedding

### fastText

the fastest way to learn word embedding based on a given data set
