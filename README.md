# Basic

## Approximate Nearest Neighbors [[link](https://github.com/spotify/annoy)]

given feature vectors, find its top k neighbors approximately

## Cosine Similarity [[link](https://github.com/gantheory/machine-learning-notes/blob/master/basic/cosine_similarity/main.py)]

(maybe) the fastest way to calculate cosine similarity in python

Note: implementation in pure Python can be very slow

## Norm [[link](https://github.com/gantheory/machine-learning-notes/blob/master/basic/norm/main.py)]

the fastest way to calculate norm of vectors, e.g. 2-norm
